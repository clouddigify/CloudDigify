This is a placeholder for the optimized PNG logo file. Since we can't directly create binary files through the edit_file tool, you'll need to:

1. Create a new PNG logo file that's less than 50KB (the current one is 418KB)
2. Use a tool like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to compress it
3. Use the filename 'logo.png' to replace the existing one

For now, all images will use loading="lazy" except for those in the critical rendering path.
